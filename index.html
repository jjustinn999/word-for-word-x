<h1> </h1>A QUESTION OF PHILOSOPHY AND MORALS</h1>
<p>
<u><b>THE ORACLE OF DELPHI</b></u>
<p>

Growing up is complicated, walking the face of the earth for these past 17 years has brought light into my eyes on so many pressing matters and situations in general. Seen young lads forced to become men all in the quest to prove victor. I ask, to what end?  Have you ever sat back or taken some time just to look around you? Think about it. All this, to what end?
<br>
Nature, the prettiest one of all, puts us on a line or what some might call a circle. Either way, we are all striving to walk the path she has chosen for us. Some say it’s a curse or a burden, others, there’s nothing better that could have happened to them. They find themselves privileged. Some or most people even turn to worship it. Is your path a curse or a blessing? As a matter of fact, this doesn’t really matter because I believe, I strongly believe we write our own stories. This’s by far one of the best gifts she has given to us. Everyone has the power to choose who they become regardless of who we were yesterday. We can always rewrite our story until the door closes and time turns its back on us. What can we possibly say? That’s the way things work or what people call “the system”. An inevitable destination for all. No one can outsmart nature. She’s the smartest and even if you’ve somehow managed to, it’ll last not. Take my word on that. Your day will come and she knows that. Everything we are doing, this path we’ve been forced to walk, to what end?

<b>My name is <i>Justin Opoku Kweku Antwi</i>.</b> They say I was born 17 years ago. Yes, that’s what I was told but what guarantee do I have this is possibly true? You know anything deceitful, wrong or negative that can be proven to be valid and can actually be believed to be the truth or the right thing. Just us a young lad born into a religion that worships evil can be made to believe other religions are not valid as a result of certain justifications to their doctrine. Most of us were born into religions and we had no choice but to accept and follow its teachings. Using myself as an example, I was born into Christianity, had to accept and follow its ways. I believe in everything the church stands for, even if I had doubts about the Christian ways, everything can be proven and justified to the brim.Does God really exist? Is Jesus the son of God? Everything can be proven to be true. Are all these things true? Yes. Is there even any guarantee that all these things are true? Yes there’s. My point is, lies can also be made to be believed as the truth. Evil can appear as good. There are other religions whose teachings contradict to your religion. You believe yours is the truth and the light but what guarantee do you have yours is the actual truth? What if everything is some kind of fabricated lie that has been backed up with prove. Christians believe Christ is the son of God but other religions say otherwise. I believe in the Christian faith but what if we are wrong? There are so many proves that Christ is truly the son of God. Even the bible says it. What if we’ve been wrong all these while? What if the bible is some made up story book that has been backed up with a lot of prove?  Remember, lies can also be proven and can appear as the truth. You can’t really trust anything you hear or see these days. Anyone can be made to see or hear anything. How sure are you all these things about world history and anything related is not some made-up story. All you need to do is prove your lie. Some say God created the world and everything in it, others say the world was formed from the smallest particle that later exploded or changed or whatever scientific term you call it and this tiny particle is what we see today.  For believers or religious people who say God created everything, where did He come from? How did He come about? Just some empty endless space and someone just comes out of nowhere and says I’m God and starts creating things? For all I know, they don’t know and can’t prove it. To the other people who believe the world evolved from some kind of particle of matter, where did this particle come from? How did it come about? When did it come about? Nothing can just come out of nowhere and turn into all this. Funny if someone ever says this. So basically, none of these people can prove what they’re saying. What do you choose to believe?  Pay attention to the questions I ask. In the first theory, I ask where God came from and how He came about. I didn’t ask when because it is believed He created time and lives out of it so time doesn’t affect Him. In the second theory, I asked when this small particle of matter came. I’ve heard those who believe in this say this particle existed millennia years ago and it took a very long time to become what it is today. Obviously, matter can’t create time. To you believers of this, who created your time? Maybe none of them can actually answer these questions. Christians might argue because the bible clearly states who created the world. I know for a fact that every single aspect of the bible can be proven or justified. For example, some people don’t believe Jesus Christ once walked the face of the earth but the bible says otherwise and there are a lot of prove Jesus did live on earth. As I said, lies can also be proven or justified too. The world was created once but here, I have two theories. I’m even sure there’re more. The fact that the world was created once means there’s only one true theory on how it was created. Are you even sure the world was created once? What guarantee do you have? Even if do have a guarantee, how sure are you it’s the truth. Lies do have guarantees too. For all I know God is the only one with the right answers. Even with this, how sure are you God actually exists? I know there are a lot of prove He does exist but one can lie and still prove to you his lie is the truth. How sure are you? Some call it faith. Either way we will know the truth at the end of the day. Christians, Muslims, Buddhists, all manner of religions, none believers, everyone, we all live with a strong faith thinking what we believe in is the truth. It doesn’t matter how strong your faith is in what you believe in, strong faith in the wrong things won’t land you on good soil. A man once told me, there was this religious leader who is said to have had an encounter with a celestial being from the Good One. There, a new religion was born. He said, “this encounter is not what they say it is, the celestial being wasn’t sent by the Good One and that everything was under false pretense.” With all his justifications and prove, I believed. But now, how sure am I what he said is true or what the religion’s doctrine says is true. All we have is hope, the hope of what we believe in being the truth. It’s more like an elephant standing on a thread. We’ll see the light at the end of the day. Even with this, how sure are you the day is going to end? How do you know this? Various religions say and can prove there’s going to be a last day. How do you know it’s the truth? Faith? We’ll see.
